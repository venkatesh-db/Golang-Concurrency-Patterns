When ever we write in to channel ==> Inform os schduler 
                                 ==> OS schduler will  immediately execute anotehr groroutine 

BEHAVIOUR2:

when we have two routines registered and when make main function sleep 
Os schduler decides to either executes first goroutine or second routine 

BEHAVIOUR3:

When ever we read from the channel ==> Inform os schduler 
                                 ==> OS schduler will  immediately execute another groroutine 4


When ever we write into the channel ==> Inform os schduler 
                                   depends it may or may not execute another go routine

BEHAVIOUR4:

whenever unnamed gororutine os may either execute or register 
Depends: channel , waitgroup and select
